# Simple Sample Sorter

To speed up the process of sorting music samples.

## Objective

To create a terminal-based file explorer using curses in python. The file explorer will facilitate a much quicker method of sorting music samples into a file heirarchy.

### Planned Features
- Tab-Switching between new virtual heirarchy and filesystem.
- 'Flag' files from multiple directories and then move them all simultaneously, prompt user to select the samples category with up/down arrows.
- Give globle settings e.g. allcaps filenames, file name general format, prompt for pack name toggle etc. 
- Reload previous heirarchies.
- Tutorial on startup.

## Current Progress

Currently still a work in progress, but has some of the above fucntionality so far.
